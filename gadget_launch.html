    <p><b>DRONE:</b>A "drone" refers to an unmanned aircraft (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle or UAV)
        that is controlled remotely or flies autonomously using a software-controlled flight plan
        and onboard sensors. Drones are used in a wide range of military and civilian applications,
        such as surveillance, photography, delivery,and agriculture, and they are also an aircraft
        without a pilot,a continuous low noise, and a male bee in a social bee colony</p>

    <h2># Need of our project</h2><!--heading 2-->
    <b><u>Agriculture:</u></b> Drones assist in precision farming by mapping fields, monitoring crop health, and applying fertilizers or pesticides more efficiently.<br>
    <b><u>Aerial Photography & Videography:</u></b> Drones have revolutionized film, real estate, and travel by making it easier and more affordable to capture stunning aerial views and cinematic shots. <br>
    <b><u>Infrastructure Inspection: </u></b>They are used to inspect large and hazardous structures like bridges, wind turbines, power lines, and oil pipelines, providing detailed images from unique vantage points.<br> 
    <b><u>Public Safety & Search and Rescue:</u></b> Drones help law enforcement, firefighters, and search and rescue teams by monitoring large areas, locating missing persons, and providing real-time situational awareness during emergencies.<br> 
    <b><u>Delivery & Logistics:</u></b>Companies are increasingly using drones for cargo and medical deliveries, offering efficient and cost-effective solutions for transporting goods to hard-to-reach or remote areas.<br>
